# FAIRDataCube
Design and implementation of FAIR Data Cube.

Added Value:
1. Reduce ambiguity of data, 
2. facilitate integration of data (both internally for different omics levels for the same sample (this has been made explicit in the metadata) but also externally (with other FAIR data sources like pathway information (from WikiPathways and other databases)
3. have clear and machine readable access policies in place.
