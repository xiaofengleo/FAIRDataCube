# FAIRDataCube
Design and implementation of FAIR Data Cube.

reduce ambiguity of data, can make use of the hierarchy in ontologies (hence my example with the cytokines: when a researcher is interested in all the cytokines instead of just interleukin 1, it is very easy to find them), facilitate integration of data (both internally for different omics levels for the same sample (this has been made explicit in the metadata) but also externally (with other FAIR data sources like pathway information (from WikiPathways and other databases), have clear and machine readable access policies in place.
